// Owns the `immersive-vr` session: it renders the robot's live WebRTC video as a panel in
// a three.js scene the operator sees in the Quest, samples both controllers each XR frame,
// runs them through VrJogMapper, and feeds the result into an existing RemoteTeleop via
// setExternalJog / command — the daemon path is unchanged (see vr.ts header).
//
// Connection model (onboard_pi_plan.md §e): the Quest browser loads this app over
// `localhost` (reached via `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080` to the laptop's Vite), which is
// a secure context, so navigator.xr + crypto.subtle work with no cert pain. The WebRTC /
// Supabase session is the same one keyboard remote mode uses.
//
// Control map (v1 — exactly the keyboard DOF, per §e "one canonical command set"):
//   each hand:  grip = CLUTCH (squeeze to move)   trigger = that arm's gripper
//               move/tilt/twist the controller -> that arm's x/y/pitch/roll + shoulder_pan
//   each hand:  B/Y = that arm's lift UP            A/X = that arm's lift DOWN
//   right only: thumbstick = base drive             thumbstick-press (hold 1.5s) = reset latch
//   left only:  thumbstick-press = E-STOP (latches + re-clutch) (R13: the operator is
//               in-headset seeing live video, satisfying the confirmation gate)
//   Recenter (move the panel cluster to the operator's current facing) = an IN-VR "Recenter"
//               button that floats above the LEFT controller and is activated by POKING it
//               with the right controller. It's hand-anchored so it's always reachable even
//               after the operator turns around; poke (not ray+trigger) because both triggers
//               are already the grippers. -> VrSession.recenter().
