// the transport the LeLab fork ships with. This is the ONLY file in the SDK core that imports
// Supabase; keeping the coupling here is the whole point (see signaling.ts + docs/SDK_TODOS.md).
// An external SDK consumer who doesn't use Supabase provides their own SignalingTransport and
// never imports this file.

// The channel calls below are a VERBATIM lift of what used to live inline in teleop.ts's
// start()/stop()/sendReady()/freshPeer(), so behavior for the fork is byte-identical.

  // robot at this layer, so that fallback dropped a non-paired user straight onto the
  // victim's public room, nullifying the whole RLS gate (audit C1). Removed: the fleet
  // is private-only now. A dev who needs a public room (e.g. `nori-dev`) passes

  // public join, never an automatic escape hatch from a failed private one.
